UXL Foundation Language SIG
===========================

The Language SIG hosts discussions and presentations focused on
how to integrate a broad range of languages to support oneAPI.
The languages at the heart of oneAPI are C++ and SYCL. This
group discusses how work done within the oneAPI open source
implementations can contribute to the ISO C++ and SYCL
specifications managed by ISO and Khronos.

The language TAB is led by Ruyman Reyes Castro <ruyman@codeplay.com>
