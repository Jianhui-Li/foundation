======================================
 Unified Acceleration (UXL) Foundation
======================================

The Unified Acceleration (UXL) Foundation exists to define a 
standards-based, cross-architecture open specification for 
accelerated computing and to foster the open-source implementations 
of the specification.

More information can be found at uxlfoundation.org_.

The community is invited to join the meetings, review the `oneAPI
Specification`_, and read the information in this repo. Contributions
can be made by joining the Special Interest Groups (SIGs) or
posting comments or questions as GitHub issues. General questions can
go to this repo, and issues specific to parts of the specification can
go to the `Specification repo`_.

Special Interest Groups (SIGs)
------------------------------

SIGs host regular meetings to organize community proposals and
contributions to the oneAPI specification. They also act as a bridge
between the community and developers working on implementations of
the oneAPI specification.

* `Language <language>`__ - This group covers topics related to
  language implementations that integrate with the oneAPI
  specification.

* `Math <math>`__ - This groups covers topics related to math
  operations.

* `Image <image>`__ - This groups covers topics related to image
  processing operations.

* `AI <ai>`__ - This group covers topics related to AI operations.

* `Hardware <hardware>`__ - This group covers topics related to the
  integration of hardware and how this is defined in the oneAPI
  specification.
